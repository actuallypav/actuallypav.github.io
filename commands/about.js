While I'm not building 3D worlds like Bruno Simon, this project pushed my JavaScript skills and helped me grow as a developer. It currently supports basic commands, and I'm actively working on expanding its features for a richer, more dynamic user experience.\n
Explore around and get to know my work!`);
