# ActuallyPav's Terminal Portfolio

## Overview

This portfolio is designed as an interactive Ubuntu terminal, offering a unique alternative to traditional portfolio formats. While I don't possess the skills to create complex 3D environments like <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/">Bruno Simon</a>, I've developed a terminal emulator that showcases my work in an engaging manner.

## Features

The terminal currently supports basic commands, displaying my projects and experience in a fun, interactive way. Building this site has also enhanced my JavaScript skills, and I now feel confident in my proficiency.

## Future Plans

I plan to expand the terminal's functionality by adding more interactive features, aiming to provide a dynamic user experience.îˆ†
