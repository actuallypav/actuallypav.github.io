## Why I'm Writing
Well, this is it. For the longest time, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do in the long run. I jumped from Cyber Security, to IoT, to DevOps, and eventually made the full circle back to Cyber Security as a Senior SOC Analyst.
None of those roles ever felt like my passion. Don’t get me wrong—I love Cloud, and I’ll tinker with IoT forever—but I never felt that spark. You get me?
What I realized is that the one thing I truly enjoyed in every role wasn’t the technology itself, but the writing. The reports, the documentation, the act of translating complexity into words—that’s what I loved. Back at university, my favourite moments weren’t lectures, they were the hours I spent writing for my blog (long gone now, for the most part).
So, I’ve decided to put real time into it—to learn to write better, to rely less on Google to “find the right words,” and to sharpen my craft enough that one day I can achieve my dream: writing my own book. For now, I'll focus on little blog posts, one a day, limit myself to an hour (like beeple's [Everydays](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays)) and try to make the best blog post, about any odd topic that comes to my mind (hoping to connect it to technology where I can).
Two people who’ve shaped me into who I am today (looking at you, David and Chris—you know who you are) have always told me the same thing: just go for it.
So here I am. <u>Going for it.</u>
