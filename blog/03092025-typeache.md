## Typeache

Day-to-day, my job includes a lot of typing. With approximately 61 minutes left in the day, it was a no-brainer to write about typing. About 75% of the way through an Equality Impact Assessment, it's only fitting to share some interesting facts about typing.
Personally, it was pretty surprising that the first patent for a typing device was granted nearly [200 years before its conception in the 1870s](https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/typing-through-time-the-history-of-the-keyboard/).
It wasn't till 20 years later that touch typing - typing without staring at the keys was introduced in a competition by [Frank Edward McGurrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Edward_McGurrin).
Now, although QWERTY was shaped by telegraphers who had to use it daily, there is a much faster keyboard alternative known as the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout), designed strictly to minimise typing strain while boosting speed, created by analysing typing efficiency and letter frequency. It was sadly a little too late for the QWERTY market had taken over.
Sadly, keyboards haven't particularly evolved since then. Hence, here are some quick-fire facts:

- The most used key is the `spacebar`, approximately every 0.1s, 600,000 people hit it simultaneously.
- On average (https://library.bellevue.edu/articles/the-untapped-gold-mine-of-typing-that-virtually-no-one-knows-about/), men are generally faster typists (44 wpm) than girls (37 wpm).
- Since 2000, only 44% of high school graduates [completed a typing course](https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/lifestyle/gen-z-doesnt-know-how-to-use-a-keyboard/). By 2019, that number dropped to 2.5%.

[Typing Through Time: Keyboard history](https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/typing-through-time-the-history-of-the-keyboard/) is a perfect resource for some incredible titbits of information, making it an absolute must-read for anyone interested in typing history. Although it seems cheap, tomorrow's read will offer a higher quality level of reading.
