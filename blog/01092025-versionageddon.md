# Versionageddon

Versioning is a deeply confusing topic. Generally, users believe that [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is the appropriate way to manage software. So, for example:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

For the most part, this remains uniform across the software industry. Until we start messing with Hardware, where seemingly legitimate businesses can set their 'version' to whatever they seem to like. For example, consider the way Intel names its Hardware. It's challenging to identify what is newer and what is not just by a glance.

Intel Core Processors - Generally used in a range of devices (e.g. Laptops, gaming PCs, workstations). For example, the `Intel Core 7 processor 150U` is split into:

| Corporate Brand | Product Brand | Performance Tier | Generation | Suffix | SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intel | Core | 7 | 1 | U | 185H |

Intel Core Processors N-Series: Generally used in low-cost, low-powered (e.g. Chromebooks, mini PCs, Embedded devices), the naming convention changes to a different format. For example, the `Intel Core i3-N305 processor` uses:

| Corporate Brand | Product Brand | Performance Tier | Prefix | SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intel | Core | i3 | N | N305 |

Suddenly, a key part of the naming convention changes. Having spoken to less tech-savvy people, they all identified the N-Series as more powerful - strictly from the name, quoting it as `N = New` or `Bigger number = Better`.

The general hardware engineer would expect their audience to know what they are doing. However, with the [PC market growing by nearly $30B in 2024](https://gam3s.gg/news/pc-gaming-market-30-billion/) alone, with the Mobile market still dominating the space, and specifications for any such device being almost unreadable for an average user, it is very easy to get lost in the versioning alone.

Given the rapid development of technology, it is nearly impossible to casually enjoy technology without having either prior or ongoing knowledge of the space, especially with several businesses attempting to profit from users' lack of understanding. Taking in the example of Nvidia Graphic Processors, the difference between a newer and one with a bigger number card like the [RTX 5070 and the RTX 4070Ti](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html), the difference in performance is nearly 10%, and in favour of the 4070Ti.

Now, the best way to not get confused is to find yourself some sort of '[Stephen](https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus)' or '[Linus](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips)' that can point us in the right direction, but even then, can they guarantee that we don't go with that gut feeling of the `Bigger is Better` mentality?
