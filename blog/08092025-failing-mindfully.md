## Failing Mindfully?

Only been a week since I "committed" to bettering myself and planning on improving my skills whilst working towards my long-term goals.

Today should've been blog number 8, and frankly, there is no excuse for not posting blogs 5 through 7, aside from pure laziness and disorganisation. For the most part, I can identify that the causes for the lack of blogs are:

- Overuse of Mobile Devices - easily getting distracted by proxy.
- Lack of organisation - where I stick to my plans.
- Lack of motivation - the mindset of "I'll do it later" is prevalent throughout my life.
- Lack of planning - I rarely write a plan, specifically for the day-to-day, but I don't have one long-term either.

All of these issues are more on a personal level. For the most part, they're characteristics that I can work towards re-mediating. I know this is already a blog site, but since I'm struggling with blog topic ideas, I've decided to try something different.

I plan to stick to my daily blog ideas, but reward myself with a self-reflection day - a day to focus on being human. A day where I don't have to be witty and don't have to focus on writing techniques and building a narrative with the backing data. A day like this is perfect for me to kick back, reflect, and use one of these "Mindful Mondays" to discuss the growth I've noticed over the past week. I can then create a plan and set some realistic goals to work towards in the following week, too.

So, as you already know, I am really worried about missing 3 blogs. Even though some topics may not be as interesting as others, I can write 5,000 words easily. Hitting this daily goal is straightforward, much like achieving my daily goal of 10,000 steps.

I rely too heavily on my mobile phone. I expect too much of people, whether it's my direct friends and family. I really need to learn to be independent and find entertainment from myself and from things I do - ideally not from a standpoint of using my computer.

That being said, my goals for next week are:

- [ ] Create a plan for the week, start easy with 5 tasks that need to be completed by the end of the day Sunday.
- [ ] Depend less on technology, mute my phone, mute notifications, don't use the computer/TV for easy sources of entertainment.
- [ ] Write all 6 blogs for the week
- [ ] Work before engaging in Entertainment (whatever it may be)

I look forward to next week's Mindful Monday, where I will review all of the above, reflect on what went well and what went wrong, and how I **PLAN**  to bounce back.
